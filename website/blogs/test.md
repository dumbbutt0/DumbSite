# 🗂️ Blog Archive README

Welcome to the blog zone, friend 👾  
This section is where I’ll be dropping write-ups, ideas, discoveries, and digital rabbit holes — some clean, some chaotic, all real.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- 🔍 **Security write-ups** from an auditor's perspective (bugs, threats, misconfigs)
- ⚒️ **PoCs and tool drops** I’ve built or tested (expect markdown, code snippets, and maybe fire emojis)
- 📓 **Journal-style posts** — things I’m thinking about, working on, or ranting about in tech & life
- 🔐 **Web3 & Blockchain Security** deep dives
- 💀 **Attack simulations** — broken contracts, forged signatures, or threat modeling with a red team mindset

> If it's here, I found it interesting enough to publish. Some of it may become projects. Some of it may become lessons.

## 🔗 How This Works

Each post is stored as a `.md` file under `/blogs`. Use the dropdown above to load a post in the viewer. This makes it easy to write in Markdown and render on the fly.

Example:
- `test-post.md` — test content
- `erc1271-alchemy-bug.md` — real write-up
- `proof-of-work-ramblings.md` — occasional ramble

## 💬 Contact or Chat
